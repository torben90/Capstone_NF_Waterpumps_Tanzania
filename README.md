# Pumpt it up! 
## Ensure availability of clean water by predicting the functionality of water points in Tanzania

This Repository presents my Capstone project of the neuefische Data Science Bootcamp in Hamburg at which I participated from February to May 2020. It is based on a data competition, held by [drivendata.org](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/), named Pump it up!
